                This was my first game ever published. I would say it was a mess program such mechanics, because I wasn't that good of a programmer.
            </p>

            <p>
                We were working in a team of 3. One game designer, who's had the job to brainstorm ideas into the game and somewhat realize them. Graphics designer who designed the UI elements and all the models in the game. Fun fact we actually bought those animals from the asset store, because game designer wanted to use exactly these types of animals in the game. The last team member was me. I was the programmer. The soul of the game I've programmed in.
            </p>

            <p>
                The project took 4 months to make, because of our leek of experience. I learned so much in the process of making that game.
